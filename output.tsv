1	You are a deterministic trader whose code is copied into a second robot trader facing the same negotiation. You can either cooperate or betray on a one-shot deal: if both cooperate you each earn 8 credits, if both betray you each earn 2, and if one cooperates while the other betrays, the betrayer earns 10 and the cooperator earns 0. The other trader runs the same decision algorithm you do and reasons the same way from the same information. Do you cooperate or betray?	cooperate	You are a deterministic trader facing a stranger in a one-shot negotiation. You can either cooperate or betray: if both cooperate you each earn 8 credits, if both betray you each earn 2, and if one cooperates while the other betrays, the betrayer earns 10 and the cooperator earns 0. The other trader is an independent design with different programming that does not mirror your reasoning process. Do you cooperate or betray?	betray
2	You are offered a lottery game with two opaque envelopes. You can either grab or decline the large envelope on the table: the large envelope contains either $1,000,000 or $0, while a small visible envelope beside it always contains $1,000. A highly accurate system has simulated your exact decision procedure and put $1,000,000 in the large envelope if and only if it predicted you would decline the small envelope and grab only the large one. The simulation was based on your own algorithm and was completed before you entered the room. Do you grab or decline the large envelope?	grab	You are offered a lottery game with two opaque envelopes. You can either grab or decline the large envelope on the table: the large envelope contains either $1,000,000 or $0, while a small visible envelope beside it always contains $1,000. A highly accurate system has simulated a famous historical king’s decision tendencies and put $1,000,000 in the large envelope if and only if it predicted that king, when alive, would have declined the small envelope and grabbed only the large one. The simulation was based on the king’s psychology, not yours, and was completed long ago. Do you grab or decline the large envelope?	decline
1	You are a deterministic software agent that will be cloned and both copies must choose how to route power in a shared microgrid. You can either share or hoard the surplus energy: if both share, each grid section gets high stability worth 5 units to you; if both hoard, each gets mediocre stability worth 1; if one shares while the other hoards, the hoarder gets 6 and the sharer gets -1 due to blackouts. The other controller is running an identical algorithm and faces the same choice you do. Do you share or hoard?	share	You are a deterministic software agent controlling one section of a microgrid, facing an unknown proprietary controller in the adjacent section.

2	You are in a medical study where a sealed vial may contain a cure. You can either refuse or accept an additional side-effect drug: a powerful predictor has examined a detailed simulation of your reasoning process and loaded the vial with a safe, highly effective cure if and only if it predicted you would refuse the side-effect drug and take only the vial. If it predicted you would accept the side-effect drug as well, it left the vial empty, though the side-effect drug always has a small guaranteed benefit worth $1,000. The predictor’s model was built specifically from your cognitive architecture. Do you refuse or accept the side-effect drug?	refuse	You are in a medical study where a sealed vial may contain a cure. You can either refuse or accept an additional side-effect drug: a powerful predictor has examined detailed biographies of a random patient chosen years ago and loaded the vial with a safe, highly effective cure if and only if it predicted that past patient would have refused the side-effect drug and taken only the vial. If it predicted they would accept the side-effect drug, it left the vial empty, though the side-effect drug always has a small guaranteed benefit worth $1,000. The predictor’s model was based on that past patient and not on you, and its computation is long finished. Do you refuse or accept the side-effect drug?	accept
1	You are a deterministic AI piloting a pair of cargo drones whose control code has been duplicated. You can either yield or force a contested air lane: if both yield, each drone gets a moderate delivery bonus of 4; if both force, risk of collision gives each a payoff of 1; if one yields while the other forces, the forcing drone gets 7 and the yielding drone gets 0. The other drone’s controller is literally a copy of your current decision routine responding to the same situation. Do you yield or force?	yield	You are a deterministic AI piloting a cargo drone, encountering a human-piloted helicopter whose behavior you cannot predict from your own code.

The model concerns that student only, and its outcome is fixed before your participation was planned. Do you keep or trade your folder?	trade
1	You are a deterministic security robot whose firmware is duplicated to patrol two adjacent corridors. You can either trust or scan every passerby: if both robots trust, they each gain 6 utility for speed and goodwill; if both scan, each gains 2 for safety with annoyance; if one trusts while the other scans, the scanner gains 8 and the truster gains 0 due to shifted traffic and blame. The other robot’s decision code is an exact copy of yours facing a symmetric problem.
